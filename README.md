paper-crane
===========
We used the newspaper library (https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) as well as Python's nltk (natural language toolkit) in order to scrape and parse the news articles from various sites. We used a variety of public meteor packages -- namely bootstrap, mongo, and collections.
